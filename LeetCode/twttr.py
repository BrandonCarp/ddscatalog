# When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, 
# as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called twttr. In a file called twttr.py, 
# implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text 
# but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

# recieve user string
# pass into helper function with logic to loop through entire string
# check it as lower then keep original

def twttr():
    str_helper(input("Enter a string : "))
